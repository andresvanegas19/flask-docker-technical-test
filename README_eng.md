# API REST - Docker flask

This project is a service that is able to recognize the longest palindrome within a text string, this will have security protocols using TOKENS. It also has a cache system that shows the last 10 palindrome words that have been searched by the api.

A palindrome is a string that when inverted is exactly the same as the original string.

```
    ana == palindromo
```

### project requirements

In order to execute the project, the following requirements must already be in place

- Docker
- Python == 3.9.2
- gcloud CLI
- git

# installation

In order to run the project locally, several steps are necessary.

1. Start by cloning the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/andresvanegas19/flask-docker-technical-test.git
```

2. It is necessary to have a google account and sign up for firebase services.
3. Create a web project, and after that go to project configuration to copy the following json and save it in a file named fbconfig.json

4. Then go to the Configuration part of the project to generate a key and with this you can communicate and validate the user tokens, when generating the key move the file to src and rename it fbAdminConfig.json

The above steps were for user authentication.

5. For a good functioning of the enpoint /history (see below part of enpoints) it is necessary to create a db of redis to use it as db and to show the last results. To create a db go to the page https://redislabs.com where they will offer a db with a space of 6MB for free.

### DOCS - redis python

[redis](https://redislabs.com/lp/python-redis/)

6. Already when creating a redis db, the following environment variables must be set in an .env file with the information given by redislabs

```
export HOST=
export PORT_DB=
export PASSWORD=

```

7. By following these steps you can now run the following command to run a container locally to test the REST API

```
docker-compose up --build -d api
```

if the container does not run you can see what problems are occurring by executing the following command

```
docker-compose logs -t -f --tail 10
```

# Construido con üõ†Ô∏è

the following technologies are used.

- [ ] Flask
- [ ] firebase_admin
- [ ] flask_restful
- [ ] redis
- [ ] flask_cors
- [ ] pyrebase
- [ ] PyCryptodome
- [ ] jwt
- [ ] flask_swagger_ui

These technologies are used because you want to build a not so robust but persistent api.

# end-points

The entry points of the application will be as follows

```
GET    /api/signup
GET    /api/token
GET    /docs
GET    /
GET    /api/history
POST   /api/palindromo
```

# testing

The following project ran the following tests to validate the proper functioning of the project.

```
python -m  src.test.test_largest_palindrome
```

# deployment

for easy deployment in GCP follow the steps at the beginning and go to the following link

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudrun/button.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?shellonly=true&cloudshell_image=gcr.io/cloudrun/button&cloudshell_git_repo=github.com/andresvanegas19/flask-docker-technical-test)

If you have gcloud CLI run the following command and then go to cloud run and run the container

```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[id-proyecto]/gcp-api
```
